This report supported by the U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute
of Justice (NIJ) presents a summary and analysis of literature on alcohol-
and drug-related crime in American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN)
communities. The report begins with an analysis of the epidemiology of
AI/AN substance abuse providing a better understanding of the nature of
alcohol and other drug use that co-occurs with AI/AN crime. Highlights of
key points that emerged include: (1) national surveys indicate AI/ANs are
more likely than the general public to report being symptomatic of alcohol
and drug use disorders as defined in the American Psychiatric Associationâ€™s
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and (2) alcohol and
drug use among AI/AN youth has been the subject of a considerable amount of
research, most of which indicates a higher lifetime prevalence relative to
the general population. After examining existing research on substance
abuse and crime in AI/AN communities, higher levels of alcohol involvement
in AI/AN crime was found and AI/ANs who use alcohol were more likely to be
a crime victim or perpetrator. The report also examined research on policy
responses to the problem of drug- and alcohol-involved crime among AI/ANs.
With the exception of one policy, local alcohol prohibition, very little is
known about the effects of criminal justice policy and specific initiatives
aimed at reducing alcohol and drug related crime in AI/AN communities. The
report presents and discusses a number of research approaches that have the
potential to improve the understanding of legal and criminal justice
responses to alcohol and drug related crime in AI/AN communities. Tables
