Deliverable 1:Data Selection Integration and Description
Instructions: Choose a dataset. Use a source of your choice or one of the data repositories or sources which were discussed in this class to obtain data which you will be mining for your final project. You may integrate information/data from several sources to develop your final analytic dataset or you may choose to work with one dataset, this largely depends on your requirements.
Describe your data (Total of 10 pts): Write a paragraph or create a table describing your data source, one should consider the following:

 The data contains 55160 rows (survey respondents) and 3141 columns (survey questions)
Discuss the quality of your data, how complete is it? Are there any known sources of errors or biases? (2 pts)

There are no null values in the data set, however, for some selected variables, statistical imputation was performed following logical inference to replace missing responses. The names of the statistically imputed variable begin with the letters 'IR'. Missing values for some demographic variables were imputed by the unweighted hot-deck technique.
The data set contains the following codes for missing/refused values for questions and have the same (or consistent) meaning across all variables:
 94 or 994 or 9994, etc.    =     DON'T KNOW
 97 or 997 or 9997, etc.    =     REFUSED
 98 or 998 or 9998, etc.    =     BLANK (i.e., not answered; not asked the question)
 99 or 999 or 9999, etc.    =     LEGITIMATE SKIP
 85 (or 985, 9985, etc.)     =     BAD DATA Logically assigned (i.e., usually inconsistent with other data)
 89 (or 989, or 9989, etc.) =     LEGITIMATE SKIP Logically assigned
